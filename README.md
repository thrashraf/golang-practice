# Go Practice Exercises

This repository contains my personal practice exercises while learning Go (Golang), following the exercises provided by [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com). Gophercises is a free course designed to help developers become more familiar with Go through coding exercises.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to improve my Go programming skills by solving various exercises that cover different aspects of the language, including but not limited to syntax, standard libraries, and common patterns in Go programming.

## Exercises

Each directory within this repository represents a separate exercise. The exercises are structured to cover a range of Go programming concepts, from basic syntax and data types to more complex topics like concurrency and web development.
